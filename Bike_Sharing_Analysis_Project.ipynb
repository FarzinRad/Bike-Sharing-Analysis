        "**business metrics like**: expected bike demand in a specific area by specific time frame, which can increase the revenue and customer satisfaction. Another metric can be bike relocation which can optimize and reduce operational costs.\n",

        "**Customer metrics like:** The most important of metrics of user side can be the aalibility of bikes in the shortest time.\n",

        "I'll use the bike sharing data from **Capital Bikeshare in Washington, D.C., USA**, for the period **between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012**. The data is <u>aggregated on an hourly basis</u>. This means that no initial and final locations of the individual rides are available, but only the total number of rides per hour.\n",
        "Moreover, additional <u>meteorological information</u> is available in the data,\n",

        "\n",
        "Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.\n",

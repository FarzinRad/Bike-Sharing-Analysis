        "**business metrics like**: expected bike demand in a specific area by specific time frame, which can increase the revenue and customer satisfaction. Another metric can be bike relocation which can optimize and reduce operational costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Customer metrics like:** The most important of metrics of user side can be the aalibility of bikes in the shortest time.\n",

        "### My Dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "I'll use the bike sharing data from **Capital Bikeshare in Washington, D.C., USA**, for the period **between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012**. The data is <u>aggregated on an hourly basis</u>. This means that no initial and final locations of the individual rides are available, but only the total number of rides per hour.\n",
        "Moreover, additional <u>meteorological information</u> is available in the data,\n",
        "which could serve as a driving factor for identifying the total number of requests for a specific time frame (bad weather conditions could have a substantial impact on bike sharing demand)."
